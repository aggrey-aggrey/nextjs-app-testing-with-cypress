# Real World Testing  of NextJS application using Cypress


I cloned the NextJS application  [Testing your first application course](https://learn.cypress.io/testing-your-first-application) on [learn.cypress.io](https://learn.cypress.io/) and added Cypress End to End test and Cypress component test.

The `start` branch is the main branch for this repo and is the starting point for the course. The [final](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress-realworld-testing-course-app/tree/final) branch contains the completed tests.
